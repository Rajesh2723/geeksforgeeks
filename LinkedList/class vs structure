The C++ class is an extension of the C language structure. Because the only difference between a structure and a class is that structure members have public access by default and class members have private access by default,
you can use the keywords class or struct to define equivalent classes.

class Node{
int data;   /// here we can make them private ,public and protected, in c we dont have the classes
Node*next;
}


struct geeksforgeeks{
char name[500];
int id[50];
float salary   /// here we are make only public by default and its in only
};
